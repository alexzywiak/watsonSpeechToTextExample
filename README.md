# watsonSpeechToTextExample <br>

1) Rename config-ADD-WATSON-CREDS.js to config.js and input app credentials. <br>
2) npm install and run node transcript.js to get a transcript.json file. <br>
3) node parser.js to split up the audio file by word. <br>

Splits somewhat accurately, but the small words get lost.
